#  About my profile picture

As you have probably seen, my profile picture is a purple duck with crown.
The general picture is generated by DALL-E, then, i asked a friend to edit the text below and he did, so i have ended up with this picture
Reasons on why my pfp is this:
1. The Duck: Ducks are generally my favourite animals
2. Purple: Purple is my favourite color
3. The Crown: Symbolizes my Minecraft PVP and SMP era, especially the SMP period, when i was famous for being good at 1.16.1+ PVP
